# Sub Epidermal: A GMTK Game Jam 2024 Game

Tasked with clearing up the patient's heart infection, you take command of the Epidermal Submarine, a machine created to cure diseases up close and personal.

Travel around the cardiovascular system, fighting deadly viruses and clearing obstructions. You might even find some unlikely allies...

This game was made for the "Built to Scale" GMTK Game Jam 2024 in less than 96 hours using Godot and Aseprite. I hope you enjoy this short adventure!
